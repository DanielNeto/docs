Managing Services
*****************


The perfSONAR Toolkit runs a number of *services*, applications constantly listening for requests to perform measurements, retrieve data and execute other tasks. This page details how you may enable and disable services through the web interface.


Enabling/Disabling Services
===========================

#. Click on **Enabled Services** in the left-hand menu

    .. image:: images/manage_services-enable1.png
#. A list of services and a description of each is provided on the screen that loads. Check the services you wish to enable and uncheck the services you wish to disable. Alternatively, you may use the *Only Enable Bandwith Services* and *Only Enable Latency Services* to enable only tests related to throughput and one-way delay testing, respectively.
