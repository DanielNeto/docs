# perfSONAR Documentation

This repository contains installation and configuration documentation related to the perfSONAR project. The master branch contains the raw files for the documents hosted at http://docs.perfsonar.net. See the remainder of the README for more information on editing and deploying the perfSONAR documentation. 

##Documentation Format
The perfSONAR documentation is generated by [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) and uses the [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) format. See those sites for details.

##Preparing Your Environment
You will need to build the files using the Sphinx Python Library. On most systems this means running the following:

```bash
pip install sphinx
```

See http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html for operating system specific instructions.


##Previewing the site

From the top-level directory of this repository run:

```bash
make html
```

This will generate a set of HTML files that can be opened in your browser under *_build/html/*. You can view the main page by opening *_build/html/index.html* in your browser. 


##Deploying Documentation to docs.perfsonar.net

Simply push your changes to the master branch and the documentation will be published within 15 minutes to http://docs.perfsonar.net. This is handled by a script running on the hosting server that polls the git repository every 15 minutes and rebuilds the site if changes are detected. If you can't wait that long, simply run `deploy.sh` to deploy your changes.
