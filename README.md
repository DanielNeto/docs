# perfSONAR Documentation

This repository contains documentation related to the perfSONAR project as a whole. The master branch contains the raw files for the documents hosted at http://docs.perfsonar.net. The wiki of the repsoitory is also the main developer wiki where cross-project collaboration can occur. See the remainder of the README for more information on editing and deploying the perfSONAR documentation. 

##Documentation Format
The perfSONAR documentation is generated by [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) and uses the [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) format. See those sites for details.

##Preparing Your Environment
You will need to build the files using the Sphinx Python Library. On most systems this means running the following:

```bash
pip install sphinx
```

See http://sphinx-doc.org/install.html for operating system specific instructions.


##Previewing the site

From the top-level directory of this repository run:

```bash
make html
```

This will generate a set of HTML files that can be opened in your browser under *_build/html/*. You can view the main page by opening *_build/html/index.html* in your browser. 


##Deploying Documentation to docs.perfsonar.net

Simply push your changes to the master branch and the documentation will be published within 15 minutes to http://docs.perfsonar.net. This is handled by a script running on the hosting server that polls the git repository every 15 minutes and rebuilds the site if changes are detected.

##Developer Wiki
The wiki of this repository is the primary developer wiki for the entire perfSONAR project. Collaboration work that spans multiple perfSONAR subprojects should live on this wiki. This includes project planning, release managent and packaging activities. See https://github.com/perfsonar/docs/wiki for the wiki itself and more details.
