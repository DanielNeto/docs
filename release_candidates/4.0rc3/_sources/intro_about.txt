What is perfSONAR?
******************

Page should contain at least the following:

    * Main point of this page is to define perfSONAR from a "this is the software you will be running" perspective. This includes:
        
        #. say in a sentence or two what perfSONAR is
        #. list the components
        #. point at other parts of docs where can learn more about components
    * Include Andy's latest image of components - would like to reference this later on bundles page
    * this page can replace :doc:`using_tools`
    * can get rid of :doc:`using_owamp` and just link to http://software.internet2.edu/owamp in this doc
    * Should likely have pointers to nuttcp and iperf3 docs as well
