Troubleshooting perfSONAR 4.0

(page under construction!)


This page contains some hints on how to troubleshoot perfSONAR 4.0.

1.  Confirm that pScheduler on the local system is functioning:
::

   pscheduler ping localhost
   pscheduler task idle --duration PT2S
   pscheduler task rtt --dest 127.0.0.1

2.  Make sure Selinux is set to Permissive or disabled

3.  Confirm firewall settings are correct by running some tests from the command line.
::

   pscheduler task throughput --dest receive_host -source send_host   
   pscheduler task rtt --source send_host --dest receive_host
   pscheduler task trace --source send_host --dest receive_host

Also try reversing source/dest for all of these.

4. Make sure pscheduler is behaving properly.

Look for ERRORs in /var/log/pscheduler.log

To enable additional logging, run (as the pscheduler or root user):
::

   pscheduler debug on  
   or
   pscheduler debug on runner scheduler  

To enable debug mode for these components only

Other useful commands include:

Look at the schedule in real time:
::

   pscheduler monitor --refresh=5

Look at a plot of the schedule (past and future)
::

   pscheduler plot-schedule --host hostname -PT30M +PT30M > plot.png

Look at schedule details for the past hour for throughput tests:
::

   pscheduler schedule --filter-test=throughput -PT1H | grep -2 myTestHost | grep -2 iperf3

For a specific host/tool:
::

   pscheduler schedule --filter-test=throughput -PT1H | grep -2 myTestHost | grep -2 iperf3
   or
   pscheduler schedule --filter-test=throughput -PT1H | egrep -2  "(nuttcp|iperf3)" | grep -2 myTestHost

Note that these commands work to remote hosts too by adding â€˜--host=hostname`
::

   pscheduler schedule --filter-test=throughput --host hostname -PT1H

To Look at results for a particular run:
::

   pscheduler result https://hostname/pscheduler/tasks/ccdad633-db0e-460d-9a63-0064b00c1f32/runs/83948ec5-3bb4-4627-b30c-4199b335c7b8
